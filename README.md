# Graplet
## App & Program Creator

**Graplet** is a project that’s been a real journey for me, evolving as I grew as a developer. It started as a simple Discord bot creator, but now it’s a playground for building programs with a [block-based IDE](https://developers.google.com/blockly) to experiment with code, featuring a beautiful & fully customizable [Flexlayout](https://github.com/caplin/FlexLayout).

### V3 - *Current Version*
Rebuilt with **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, Graplet V3 is a web tool where you can mess around with the console, play with inputs, and just have fun. It’s more about exploring than being feature-packed. Some features might not work as they should - like extensions 😅. It’s kind of an experiment.

### 🚀 Looking Ahead: V4 in 2025
V4 is where things get *really* exciting - a 3D code editor built with **Three.js**. Think [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), but in 3D, where you can create models and interactive experiences. It’s all about making coding more creative and fun. I won’t be continuing the third version, even if I quite liked how it turned out - it was just too generalized. With the skills I’m currently learning, I’m sure I can level the fourth version up much more! 😄

### 📚 A Journey Through Versions
- **V1:** Started as a Flask app, my first step - It was a total mess!  
- **V2:** Rebuilt with vanilla JavaScript - yeah, imagine that. It was a complete mess too.  
- **V3:** Now with Vite, React, and TypeScript, ready to play.  
- **V4:** Coming in 2025, bringing the dream of a 3D code editor to life ✨

**Graplet** is a passion project, built on curiosity and a love for sharing the fun of code. It’s **open source** and will always be ❤️
